Description: 
- Between frequent vs non-frequent users, researchers compared demographic, socioeconomic status, health conditions and access to care among these ED utilisation groups.
  - Demographic data included age, sex, marital status and race/ethnicity. Socioeconomic data included employment status, povertyâ€“income ratio and education.
  - Multivariable logistic regression
- Found that frequent users had higher rates of being female, racial minority, less educated, less employment, more impoverished, more comorbidities, same mental health
  visits, higher rates of medicaid, higher outpatient/pcp visits etc !!!
- "If these patients had the ability to access same day primary care appointments or improved access to other subspecialty services, the number of ED visits could decrease." (commonly mentioned)
- Programs with patient navigators could help patients manage their chronic illnesses and potentially avoid ED visits and future hospitalisations.

#### Factors affecting emergency department service utilization by a chronically homeless population

Description:
- "Bivariate analyses of nonED, moderate-ED, and high-ED users were conducted using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests. If ANOVA or chi-square tests were significant (P<.05), pairwise comparisons were made using t-tests or dichotomous chi-square tests, respectively, and the Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons was applied"
- Measures that were significant were entered into a multinomial logistic regression model to identify independent factors associated with moderate and high-ED use compared to non-ED use.
- Similar to prior reports poor health, including medical, psychiatric, and addiction problems, was the strongest correlate of frequent ED use. Significant associations were also observed with
  extensive use of non-ED services and to a lesser extent housing instability.
- High ED utilization was correlated with poor health, but not decreased access to alternative health and social services !!!
- There was a trend towards decreased sense of coordination between outpatient providers by high ED utilizers,

Description:
- Diagnoses most commonly reported as predictive of recidivism include those related to the respiratory system, traumatic injuries,
  and pain (particularly chest and abdominal pain).

Description:
- Selected the first visit for each patient between a universial time A and time B extending to a year out as the feature space for each patient
- Classified frequent users as 90% percentile users
- "Diagnosis codes were aggregated into Clinical Classification Software (CCS) groups for ease of reporting"
