Description: 
- Between frequent vs non-frequent users, researchers compared demographic, socioeconomic status, health conditions and access to care among these ED utilisation groups.
  - Demographic data included age, sex, marital status and race/ethnicity. Socioeconomic data included employment status, povertyâ€“income ratio and education.
  - Multivariable logistic regression
- Found that frequent users had higher rates of being female, racial minority, less educated, less employment, more impoverished, more comorbidities, same mental health
  visits, higher rates of medicaid, higher outpatient/pcp visits etc !!!
- "If these patients had the ability to access same day primary care appointments or improved access to other subspecialty services, the number of ED visits could decrease." (commonly mentioned)
- Programs with patient navigators could help patients manage their chronic illnesses and potentially avoid ED visits and future hospitalisations.
