# CrossoverEDResearch

We recently acquired the capability to track all of our patients’ ER visits and hospital admissions and found that a small proportion of our patients have been to the ER four or more times in a 14 month period. 

<code>We would like to evaluate to what extent these patients share common risk factors that CrossOver is able to influence to reduce their and similar patients’ ER utilization in the future</code>.

This is our first time undertaking such an evaluation and, as a first step, would like you to research if similar evaluations have been done and, if so, use the findings of these studies to document the <code>common risk factors correlated with high ER utilization</code>. You will then use these findings to develop a similar analysis using our frequent ER user patient data. These data can be collected via <code>database queries, chart reviews and patient interviews</code>.

The two key project deliverables are <code>a report describing your methodology and results and a PowerPoint presentation</code> summarizing the same to be presented to our Clinical Operations Committee.
